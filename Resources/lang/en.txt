// Guide - About TED
guide_about_ted_text=TED is a non-profit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 25 years ago, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas with multiple initiatives.\n\nThe annual TED Conference invites the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes. Their talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Al Gore, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani,Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Isabel Allende and UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown.\n\nThe annual TED Conference takes place in Long Beach, California, with simulcast in Palm Springs; TEDGlobal is held each year in Oxford, UK. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TEDTalks are posted daily, and the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as the ability for any TEDTalk to be translated by volunteers worldwide.\n\nTED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world are given the opportunity to put their wishes into action; TEDx, which offers individuals or groups a way to host local, self-organized events around the world, and the TEDFellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to become part of the TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.

// Guide - About TEDx
guide_about_tedx_text=In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx.\n\nTEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxUlaanbaatar, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxUlaanbaatar event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group.\n\nThe TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.

// Guide - About TEDxUlaanbaatar
guide_about_tedxub_text=As the idea behind TED is sharing knowledge, at TEDxUlaanbaatar, our speakers aim to present inspirational stories about the past, present, and future of Mongolia.\n\nThey will speak on topics ranging from Mongolian history to the vast web of Mongolian peoples across the world, from intellectual puzzles to the eclectic fusion of modern Mongolian hip-hop with traditional instruments, from the children of Ulaanbaatar’s streets to the country’s aggressive economic future.\n\nWith our first TEDxUlaanbaatar event, we hope to debut Mongolia to the TED community through a new lens, focusing on Mongolia’s rich past and promising future. In a blend of both Mongolians and expatriates, our team of organizers, contributors, and speakers are all working towards Mongolia’s LEGACY: Honoring Tradition, Designing the Future.
