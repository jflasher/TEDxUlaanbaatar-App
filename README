This is the application that was distributed for the TEDxUlaanbaatar event that took place in 2011. 

The app is based on Titanium platform which is a cross-platform HTML/CSS/JS solution. You can find more about Titanium by going to http://www.appcelerator.com. You will need Titanium in order to run this app.

This was my first time using Titanium and this is my first project up on GitHub so please be kind. 

Anyone is free to use this code for any related project!
